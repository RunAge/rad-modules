## Description:

Mailer service was created to handle email sending. Nonetheless, it can be configured to use any SMTP server or SendGrid account.

If you have your own SMPT server or SendGrid account but you don't have code to bridge your app with mail services, you can use our Mailer service and simply call its methods in your code to send an email.
